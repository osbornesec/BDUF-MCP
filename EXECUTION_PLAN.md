# Interactive BDUF Orchestrator MCP Server - Execution Plan

## Overview

This execution plan follows the BDUF (Big Design Up Front) methodology that our MCP server implements. We'll proceed through structured phases with approval gates, comprehensive planning, and systematic implementation with quality assurance at each step.

## Execution Methodology

- **BDUF Approach**: Comprehensive upfront planning before implementation
- **Approval Gates**: Human review and approval at critical decision points
- **Quality Assurance**: Testing and validation at each milestone
- **Iterative Refinement**: Continuous improvement based on feedback
- **Documentation-Driven**: Maintain comprehensive documentation throughout
