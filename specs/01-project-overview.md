## Executive Summary

The Interactive BDUF Orchestrator MCP Server is a revolutionary Model Context Protocol server that combines Big Design Up Front (BDUF) methodology with AI-human collaborative orchestration for software development projects. This system transforms traditional AI coding assistance from reactive, task-by-task support into proactive, comprehensive project management and execution.

## Project Vision

### Mission Statement
To create an intelligent project orchestration system that leverages BDUF methodology to plan, decompose, and coordinate software development projects while maintaining human agency and enabling collaborative decision-making between humans and AI.

### Strategic Objectives
1. **Comprehensive Planning**: Implement BDUF methodology for upfront project design and architecture
2. **Intelligent Decomposition**: Break down complex projects into manageable, sequenced tasks
3. **Human-AI Collaboration**: Maintain human control over critical decisions while leveraging AI capabilities
4. **Quality Assurance**: Ensure architectural coherence and quality throughout project execution
5. **Adaptive Management**: Enable plan adaptation based on implementation discoveries

## Business Context

### Problem Statement
Current AI coding assistants operate reactively, responding to individual requests without comprehensive project understanding. This leads to:
- Architectural inconsistencies across implementation work
- Lack of comprehensive project planning and coordination
- Missing context for individual coding tasks
- No systematic approach to complex project management
- Limited quality assurance and coherence validation

### Solution Approach
The Interactive BDUF Orchestrator addresses these challenges by:
- Performing comprehensive upfront analysis and design (BDUF)
- Decomposing projects into dependency-aware task sequences
- Providing optimal context packages for each implementation task
- Maintaining human oversight and approval for critical decisions
- Enabling collaborative ideation, design, and documentation processes

### Target Benefits
