- Server implementation patterns
- Tool definition and communication protocols
- Error handling and deployment strategies

## Quick Start Guide

### Understanding MCP
1. Start with **MCP Fundamentals** to understand the protocol basics
2. Review the architecture and key concepts
3. Understand how MCP solves integration complexity

### Building with Context7
1. Read **Context7 Integration** for documentation access patterns
2. Implement the `resolve-library-id` and `get-library-docs` tools
3. Follow the workflow examples for seamless integration

### Adding Perplexity Search
1. Study **Perplexity MCP Integration** for web search capabilities
2. Set up authentication and API configuration
3. Implement the `perplexity_search_web` tool

### Server Architecture
1. Review **MCP Server Architecture** for implementation best practices
2. Apply modular design patterns
3. Implement proper error handling and monitoring

## Key Technologies Covered

- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Open standard for AI model integration
- **Context7**: Library for up-to-date documentation and code examples
- **Perplexity AI**: Web search and research capabilities
- **MCP Servers**: Implementation patterns and architecture

## Implementation Patterns

### Basic MCP Server Structure
```typescript
interface MCPServer {
  initialize(): Promise<void>;
  getCapabilities(): ServerCapabilities;
  listTools(): Tool[];
  callTool(name: string, arguments: any): Promise<ToolResult>;
}
```

### Tool Implementation Example
```typescript
const searchTool = {
  name: 'web_search',
  description: 'Search the web for information',
  inputSchema: {
    type: 'object',
    properties: {
      query: { type: 'string' },
      recency: { type: 'string', enum: ['day', 'week', 'month', 'year'] }
    },
    required: ['query']
  }
};
```

## Best Practices Summary

1. **Keep servers simple and focused** - Single responsibility principle
2. **Use capability negotiation** - Declare and validate supported features
3. **Implement proper error handling** - Explicit error channels and resilience
4. **Design for composability** - Modular, interchangeable components
5. **Secure by design** - Proper authentication and isolation
6. **Monitor and observe** - Logging, metrics, and health checks
